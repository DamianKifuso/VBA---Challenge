# VBA-Challenge
VBA assignment
I have created a script that looped through all stocks for one year to all worksheets that yielded the ticker symbol, yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the given year to the closing price of that year, the percentage change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and the stock volume of that year.
Also the script returned the stock with "Greatest % increase", "greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
